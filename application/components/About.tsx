# Amjad Masad Chatbot

A chatbot trained to act like [Amjad Masad](https://twitter.com/amasad), built with [LangChain](https://twitter.com/langchainai) and Next.js.

The OpenAI model being used is \`text-davinci-003\`, trained with:
 - Major parts of the [Replit docs](https://docs.replit.com)
 - The [Replit blog](https://blog.replit.com)
 - The Replit [landing page](https://replit.com)
 - The Replit Employee Organization Chart
 - Amjad's [personal blog](https://amasad.me)
 - Amjad's [AmA Repl](https://replit.com/@amasad/AmA?v=1)
 - Amjad's Podcasts
 - Some of [Amjad's Tweets](https://twitter.com/amasad)
 - Replit's [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms) and [Community guidelines](https://welcome.moderation.repl.co)
 - Some random facts the AI should be aware of

All of this data was compiled into a \`.index\` file.  [Zahid Khawaja](https://twitter.com/chillzaza_) has an [Awesome Tutorial](https://replit.com/@zahidkhawaja/Replit-Assistant?v=1) on how to do this if you want to make your own.

Speaking of which, Thanks a lot Zahid, I couldn't have done this without you üôè
